    Compile a python callable function ``udf`` with

    ``type_signature`` into CUDA PTX together with the generated output type.

    The output is expected to be passed to the PTX parser in `libcudf`
    to generate a CUDA device function to be inlined into CUDA kernels,
    compiled at runtime and launched.

    Parameters
    ----------

      a python callable function

    type_signature:
      a tuple that specifies types of each of the input parameters of ``udf``.
      The types should be one in `numba.types` and could be converted from
      numpy types with `numba.numpy_support.from_dtype(...)`.

      The compiled CUDA PTX

    output_type:
      An numpy type
